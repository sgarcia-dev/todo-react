# Todo React

A simple Todo App built with ReactJS that adheres to established React best practices such as never mutating state, using PropTypes, correct state lifting, and use of stateless components where appropriate. Built with GulpJS and Browserify instead of Webpack to showcase that Webpack isn't the only way to build ReactJS apps.

## How to Run

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you have it installed)
